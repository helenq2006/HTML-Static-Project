    <li class="hobbies">One of my hobbies is drawing. I started when I was like 5 and I took art classes for most of my childhood. I've used a range of mediums including graphite, pink
       acrylic, oil, colored pencils. I don't draw as much anymore because I don't have time and it can take me up to a week to finish a piece. </li>

    <li class="hobbies">Another hobby is listening to music. I'm always listening to music when I'm doing homework or when I'm on the train. My favorite genres are Hiphop and RNB.
       My favorite artists include A$AP Rocky, Travis Scott, Partynextdoor, and Bryson Tiller. My current favorite song is Blame by Bryson Tiller. </li>

    <li class="hobbies">One of my interest is minions. I have watched all the movies and I own a lot of minion related things including plushies. </li>
