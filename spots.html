            <td>One of my favorite things about living in NYC is how diverse it is. You can try a bunch of different food without having to go to different countries.</td>
            <td>One of my least favorite things about living here is how it's a tourist city. Manhattan  is always crowded with slow walkers trying to take pictures of Times Square</td>

            <td>I also like how there are always things to do, whether it be events, popups, or a restaurant to eat at. It's hard to be bored.</td>
            <td>Everything here is also really expensive, especially in Manhattan, so I guess I don't like how cost of living is so high here.</td>
