    <h1>Spots in NYC</h1>
    
    <h2>Favorite parts</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite things about living in NYC is how diverse it is. You can try a bunch of different food without having to go to different countries.</p>
    <p>I also like how there are always things to do, whether it be events, popups, or a restaurant to eat at. It's hard to be bored.</p>

    <h2>Least favorite parts</h2>
    <p>One of my least favorite things about living here is how it's a tourist city. Manhattan  is always crowded with slow walkers trying to take pictures of Times Square and the Empire State Building.</p>
    <p>Another thing I don't like is how bad the public transportation is. Unlike other developed cities in the world, our subway system is really nasty and unsafe.</p>
    <p>Everything here is also really expensive, especially in Manhattan, so I guess I don't like how cost of living is so high here.</p>
